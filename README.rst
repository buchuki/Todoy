Todoy
=====

Todoy is (yet another) task management application coded in Python and using
the Kivy user interface library. It will probably never be finished, so I don't
intend to go overboard documenting it, yet.

Todoy will distinguish between the following types of tasks:

* Habits: Things you want to do every day or every week
* Appointments: Things you have to do at a specific time
* Commitments: Things you have to do on a recurring basis at a specific time
* Tasks: Things you want to do at some point on a specific days
* Goals: Things you want to accomplish
